# CMS Workflow Module

**Please note: this module is no longer actively maintained.**

## Requirements
 * SilverStripe 2.4 or newer
 * `legacydatetimefields` module (see http://silverstripe.org/legacydatetimefields-module)


## Installation

You need to choose an 'approval path'. This details the actual process a request goes through before
it gets published to the live site.
 
There are two approval paths supplied: "Two Step" and "Three Step".

### Two Step

Author submits a request. Publisher approves it change is pushed live immediately.

This workflow is automatically set up for you and doesn't need any configuration.

### Three Step

Author submits a request. Approver approves it. Publisher publishes it at a later date.

Attach the following decorators in your `mysite/_config.php`:

	// remove two-step decorators
	Object::remove_extension('WorkflowRequest', 'WorkflowTwoStepRequest');
	Object::remove_extension('SiteTree', 'SiteTreeCMSTwoStepWorkflow');
	Object::remove_extension('SiteConfig', 'SiteConfigTwoStepWorkflow');
	// add three-step decorators
	Object::add_extension('WorkflowRequest', 'WorkflowThreeStepRequest');
	Object::add_extension('SiteTree', 'SiteTreeCMSThreeStepWorkflow');
	Object::add_extension('LeftAndMain', 'LeftAndMainCMSThreeStepWorkflow');
	Object::add_extension('SiteConfig', 'SiteConfigThreeStepWorkflow');
	
Refresh your database schema through `http://<your-host>/dev/build`.

## Usage

Based on your permission levels, authors in the CMS will see different actions on a page,
and a new "Workflow" tab listing open requests.

## Popup alerts

You can allow Administrator users to Publish without giving a comment. 
by placing the following in your mysite/_config.php file:
This will disable the popup for this situation.

	LeftAndMainCMSWorkflow::set_prompt_admin_for_comments(false);

## Email alerts

Email alerts are configurable by the developer.

The following line sets a config option

    WorkflowRequest::set_alert(CLASS, EVENT, GROUP, NOTIFY);

CLASS is one of either WorkflowPublicationRequest or WorkflowDeletionRequest

EVENT is one of

 * request
 * publish (3 step only)
 * approve 
 * deny
 * cancel
 * comment

GROUP is either author or publisher or approver

NOTIFY is either true or false

## Customising strings via translation

The cmsworkflow uses the translation facilities of SilverStripe extensively.
This allows us to support the module in different languages, with many
languages available out of the box.

If you want to customise these strings further, there is another module
called customtranslation that allows you to override the strings provided
in the lang files, without changing the lang files. The module can override
strings across the whole site, not just cmsworkflow. customtranslation will
be supported for SilverStripe 2.4.1 and up.

See [customtranslation on silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org/custom-translations-module/)
